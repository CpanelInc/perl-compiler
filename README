INSTALL

This doesn't work on windows any more as we removed threads support during a re-write. Every branch only supports a specific version of Perl.

perl Makefile.PL && make test && make install

USAGE

Bytecode and CC bakends have been removed as they were incomplete and unused.

To compile perl program foo.pl with the C backend, do

    perlcc -ofoo foo.pl
    ./foo

STATUS

C is stable, CC is unstable.
Bytecode stable until 5.16
The Bytecode compiler is disabled for 5.6.2, use the default instead.

See STATUS for details.
