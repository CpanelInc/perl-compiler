#
# This file tracks known errors in the compiled unit test suite.
#
# FILE FORMAT: $test\s+$type\s+$description
#    $test = Name of unit test file. A Symlink file should exist in this directory pointing to this file.
#            The file will have -- corresponding to slashses so unit tests can live in subdirectories under t/
#    $type = Type of test failure. See below for possible values.
#    $description = Information that will display on the TODOs so the test will pass.
#
# Failure profiles $type may be set to:
#    BC      => B::C Fails to generate c code - 
#    GCC     => gcc cannot compile generated c code - 
#    SIG     => Compiled binary exits with signal - 
#    PLAN    => Crashes before completion - 
#    TESTS   => Some tests are failing - 
#    SEQ     => The tests run out of sequence - 
#    TODO    => TODO test unexpectedly failing - 
#    COMPAT  => Test isn't useful for B::C. This test will be a skip_all. 
#    SKIP    => Test so much broken that we prefer to skip it for now. ( ~skip_all )
#
# NOTES:
# - Any line in this file not corresponding to a symlink in this folder will be ignored.
# - Fields are white space delimited. It's assumed $test and $type will have no spaces in them.
